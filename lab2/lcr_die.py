#
# This python module contains a special function roll_die, detailed below, which rolls a standard LCR game die.
# The standard LCR game dice has 6 sides, three of which have a dot ".", the remaining three have "L", "C", and "R"
# on them. This function is separate from the other code in order to aid testing. Other functions and logic in this
# module exists to allow us to force specific rolls for testing purposes.
